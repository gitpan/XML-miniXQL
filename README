NAME
    XML::miniXQL - Module for doing stream based XML queries

SYNOPSIS
      use XML::miniXQL;

      my $results = XML::miniXQL::queryXML({Style => 'Hash'}, $xml, @searches);

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides a simplistic XQL like search engine for XML
    files. It only supports a subset of XQL, because it does all
    it's searching on streams, not on the document as a whole
    (unlike XML::XQL). For this reason, only ancestor relationships
    are supported, not sibling or child relationships. XML::miniXQL
    also doesn't return nodes, it only returns the value (text)
    found as the result of the query. As a result, you can't use
    this module for node manipulation, however it's faster than
    XML::XQL, so it can be used on a web backend or some such
    environment. Xmerge is provided as an example of usage.

    The queries are passed in as an array of queries, and the
    results passed out as either a simple tuple list (each alternate
    value is either the query or the result respectively), or as a
    hash with the values being an array. See xmerge.pl as an example
    of the Hash style. The List style is the default.
