				Co-Authoring a new O'Reilly book called "Perl and XML". This will detail ways to use
				perl to process and generate XML. It will included details on XML::Parser, and the
				many modules that use it. Details of my CGI to XML gateway, are also included and
				some of my other XML modules. Release date is set for 3Q 1999. This work is in my
				"spare" time!

			<details>
				Initially I was contracted to design an MMI for a product called the MTU (a little
				black box that monitors signal strength and other variables of radio transmitters).
				This involved writing a Java application to set parameters on the MTU, and read
				values back out again. Following on from that I joined Development IT which
				develops all the intranet applications at Basingstoke. First I designed and implemented
				a small library system to keep track of publications and books in the internal
				library. Then I worked on a Resource Model. This allows managers to plan and track
				resource allocations on projects over a 2 year period. Currently I'm developing a
				timesheet application. This involves developing new methods of working with XML, such
				as the new CGI to XML gateway that is to be integrated into perl's core CGI module.

				Employeed again as a graduate I rapidly rose through the company, taking on
				projects such as a major upgrade for Searle Pharmaceuticals, Designing and
				implementing Comms security over RAS, Internationalisation in the Oxygen
				application, performance improvements and internal tools. While working in
				Client Development I worked both on and off site for major corporations including
				Monsanto Searle Pharmaceuticals, Schering Plough, Lombard Business Finance, Astra
				Pharmaceuticals and Royal &amp; Sun Alliance. A major project
				while at ISS was developing their intranet. This rapidly grew from a project
				running on my own workstation, into a dedicated web server, serving up thousands
				of documents, and running some of the core infrastructure at the company.

				Working over the summer at this lively new software house. I worked in small
				teams helping to realise their first Windows version of their aging DOS
				application. I worked in C++ and SQL, working on core parts of the code, and
				designing and optimising large queries. I also designed a database consolidation
				routine called "Behemoth" which took gigabyte databases and distilled the data
				for reporting purposes.
